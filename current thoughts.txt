image1.jpg --- min_area = len * 2, max_area = len * 12
can consistenly detect control line but also highlights small
fragments


image2.jpeg --- having area be >> min_area doesn't work
area is not large enough, region found is often a smaller
subset of the whole area

range 85 - 92 works better but causes the detection of random areas
min_area = len * 2, max_area = len * 12 (maybe lessen)


image3.jpg --- min_area = len * 3, max_area = len * 12
Can consistently find control line


image4.jpg --- test and control lines blend in with background
so much that they can't be detected, would have to drastically alter
image pre-processing to get it to work


TESTS using range 85 - 92 and min_area = len * 2, max_area = len * 12
extending region if > min_area
only drawing if horizontally rectangular and area < max_area

strip1 - gets ctrl line
strip2 - gets ctrl line, one small rectangular fragment (below ctrl line)
strip3 - gets like half of ctrl line (very small rectangle, not extending so not meeting min_area requirement)
strip4 - gets most of ctrl line (not extended)
strip5 - gets ctrl line, very small fragments
strip6 - gets ctrl line
strip7 - gets ctrl line (detects big region, bigger box around it)
strip8 - gets ctrl line (not extended)
strip9 - gets ctrl line, 2 small rectangular fagments (one above one below)
strip10 - gets ctrl line (not extended)
strip height = 5ish out of 240 (2%)


image2 - fragments where solution piles up
strip1 - gets ctrl line (not extended), one big rectangular framgent and small fragment below
strip2 - gets ctrl line (not extended), one square fragment and one really small fragment below
strip3 - gets ctrl line (not extended), one big rectangular fragment below
strip4 - gets ctrl line, one big rectangular fragment below
strip5 - gets ctrl line (not extended), one big rectangular fragment above, one below
strip6 - gets ctrl line, one big rectangular fragment above, one below
strip7 - gets ctrl line, one rectanuglar fragment below
strip8 - doesn't get control line, only fragment below
strip9 - gets ctrl line, one big fragment above, 2 small ones below
strip10 - gets ctrl line (not extended), one big fragment above, one below
strip height = 4ish out of 240 (1.6%)

strip1 - doesn't get ctrl line, only line below
strip2 - ^
strip3 - doesn't get anything
strip4 - ^
strip5 - ^
strip6 - ^
strip height = 20ish out of 1000 (2%)

use range of (1.5% to 4%)
